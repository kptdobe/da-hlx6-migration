# da-hlx6-migration

Tooling and analysis to migrate DA projects from the **da** backend (da-admin, Cloudflare R2)
to the **hlx6** backend (helix-api-service, AWS S3 "source bus").

## Objectives
1. Utils to read and write both backends at the storage level.
2. An exhaustive list of content structure differences between the two backends.
3. A migration util writing directly to S3, able to handle projects with millions of objects.
