# da-hlx6-migration

Tooling and analysis to migrate DA projects from the **da** backend (da-admin, Cloudflare R2)
to the **hlx6** backend (helix-api-service, AWS S3 "source bus").

## Objectives
1. Utils to read and write both backends at the storage level.
2. An exhaustive list of content structure differences between the two backends.
3. A migration util writing directly to S3, able to handle projects with millions of objects.

## Reference projects
- da: https://da.live/#/kptdobe/sample-content-da
- hlx6: https://da.live/#/kptdobe/sample-content-hlx6

## Usage (all read-only)
Credentials and runtime settings are loaded from the local, git-ignored `.dev.vars` file; its non-empty values take precedence over shell variables. It holds the R2 read-only token, AWS profile/role settings, and target media API token. Keep its mode owner-only (`chmod 600 .dev.vars`).

```bash
npm install
node bin/dump.js -b da   <org/site>             # download a site to analysis/da/<org>/<site>
node bin/dump.js -b hlx6 <org/site>             # download a site to analysis/hlx6/<org>/<site>
node bin/compare.js <da-dump> <hlx6-dump>       # structural diff
node bin/preflight.js -v <org/site>             # migration blockers for a da site
npm test && npm run lint
```

The sample migration command is pinned to `kptdobe/sample-content-da` → `kptdobe/sample-content-hlx6-migrated` and is dry-run by default:

```bash
node bin/migrate.js --refresh-source
```

Execution additionally requires the dedicated `da-hlx6-migration` AWS role, the R2 read-only credentials, and a target-scoped `media:upload` token. Put all of these in `.dev.vars`, then run `node bin/migrate.js --refresh-source -x`. It has no delete path and refuses unplanned target objects.
